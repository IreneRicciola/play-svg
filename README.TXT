pLAySVG: making graphical programming as easy as py
http://play-svg.sourceforge.net
=============

pLAySVG is a python library that facilitates the generation and manipulation of SVG vector graphics.  It is designed to be easy to use, even for non-programmers.  It is geared toward educational and artistic use.  It contains code to  construct XML nodes corresponding to SVG elements, perform geometric operations, manipulate colors, and produce complex shapes.  

It can be used as a library to generate SVG images 'from scratch' by writing a python script that describes an image.    As well, pLAySVG can be used as a utility in the development of Inkscape plugins.  The project contains several examples of Inkscape scripts.

To install pLAySVG, first ensure you have python 2.4 or later installed.  Then extract the compressed file.  This will create a directory called play-svg.  Enter this directory using a command prompt and install the libraries by entering:
python setup.py install or in Linux sudo python setup.py install, which will enable the installation of plugins.  

If you are using Linux, the extensions will automatically be installed for you as long as your setup has you extensions installed at /usr/share/inkscape/extensions/.  Otherwise, to install the Inkscape plugins, copy all files in the inkex folder into your Inkscape extensions folder.   See http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/ScriptingHOWTO for more info on how to install Inkscape scripts.  You must first install pLAySVG for these plugins to work.
