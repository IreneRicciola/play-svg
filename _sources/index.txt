   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to pLAySVG's documentation!
===================================

pLAySVG is a python library for the development and manipulation of SVG vector graphics through scripting. pLAySVG's goal is to simplify the creation of graphics based on geometric relationships. It's intended for educational and artistic use.  pLAySVG is a gift from The Playful Geometer

Our code library includes modules not listed here.   However, some of our modules have not been adapted from earlier days when we were dependent on other XML libraries and so we have only documented the modules that should be working properly.

Requirements:
pLAySVG requires a Python 2.5 installation with lxml libraries.   If you install our suggested SVG viewer `Inkscape <http://inkscape.org/>`_, you can be sure the requirements are fulfilled, as Inkscape depends on these libraries as well.
